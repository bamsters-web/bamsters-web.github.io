<p>Now that we have created our first webpage. <br> I need to look at building a website that will start things off.
    first we look at.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Test a website</strong></li>
            <li>Potters Bar Crusaders Knights website</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p>There are more websites that we can build, to test the css styles and html coding. <br> However, 
            we have to understand what is required on the website. Steps:
            
            <ul>
                <li>Design a template first.</li>
                <li>How many sections are required.</li>
                <li>Create CSS style with complicated features.</li>
        </ul>
